PimpMyTickets is a TBC (TrinityCore/OregonCore) GM Ticket AddOn made to simplify Game Masters' life.  
The main guidelines are to keep the AddOn easy to use, customisable and memory efficient.  


Few features aren't displayed on screenshots, such as the Banhammer function available from name lists, text channels and the target frame.   
The frame on the left is a clickable ticket list displayed after clicking on 'List'.   
Spam reports are left black and other tickets are colored based on the author being online or not. New/Closed/Abandoned tickets are automatically updating this list. More than 6 tickets at a time will add a scrollbar at the left of it, letting you navigate through all your ticket list either with it or with your mousewheel.
